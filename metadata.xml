Adds 6 new passive items and trinkets that modify your blue flies. The fly modifications are the same used by the Locusts and 7 Seals trinkets. The items include:

Short-Tempered Fly - flies explode on contact
Poison Hive - makes all of your flies poisonous
Sedated Fly - flies slow down enemies
Deathbringer - flies deal 4x Isaac's damage
Fly of Conquest - flies have a 25% chance to respawn after they die
Vibrant Fly - randomizes each fly spawned with one of the above

The flies are modified as soon as they spawn. Picking up one of the item will also transform all flies you currently have or will spawn 3-8 flies if you don't have any.

Items such as Guppy's Head, Jar of Flies, Hive Mind and all others synergize with HiveMod. This is especially useful when transformed into Guppy!

The item pools are also updated to include the new items. Some of them can only appear in Treasure Rooms, others in Devil or Angel Rooms, etc.

There are also trinkets that have the same effect, although they have only a 10% chance to modify a blue fly.

PS: this is my first ever mod for The Binding of Isaac and first time coding in LUA. I wanted to make this mod for a while now and I hope to see it implemented in the game one day.</description>
